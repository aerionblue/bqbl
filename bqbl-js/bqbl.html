    <h4>Disclaimers</h4>
    <p>Our scraper doesn't count certain things that earn points in BQBL. All of
    these will be added manually in the tracking spreadsheet later:
      <ul>
        <li>Fumbles returned for TD (+10 points) &mdash; these are counted in
          'fumbles lost', so the total score will be off by 5
        <li>QB sacked for a safety (+20 points)
        <li>Game-winning drive (&minus;12 points)
        <li>Game-losing INT-TD in OT (+50 points)
        <li>Non-injury mid-game benching (+35 points) &mdash; this is a judgment call that will be added later
        <li>All 24/7 points &mdash; we can only automatically determine on-the-field points
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>We also differ from Grantland (and the NFL box score) in that we deduct sack yardage from the QB passing yard total.</p>
